## Meetup

### Introduction

Ege: 24th meetup first of 2025!

### News

Ege: on march 10th will be a new event about how to use WoT in mixed reality environments.

Ege: more are in the process to be planned

### Meetup Presentation

Ege: with us we have Andreas Eberhart, he has extensive business and developer experience. Currently he is CEO of Dashjoin.

Andreas: Thank you for introduction. This is a join work with Ege.

Andreas: We started a joint work talking about json schema and WoT presented at API days in paris. We have the code available.

Andreas: we have billions of devices in the internet, it is important to manage devices in a generic way. On the other hand you want to personalize features for some specif use cases.

Andreas: Security is important in this scenario. We build a local development platform and opensource it. It provides a lot of basic features and therefore it helped us to build the WoT manager.

Andreas: we used openid for user management. In southbound we have the actual WoT interaction. Right now we support only REST API

Andreas: Postgres is used to store Thing Descriptions.

#### Discovery

Andreas: the process start with a URL but supports a Role Based Access Control to protect selected devices.

#### Properties and Actions

Andreas: we generated device pages, where you can inspect low level code (based on jsonata) and control devices using UI (generated on the fly with JSON schema).

Andreas: forms are generated by interpreting the TD.

#### Background Knowledge

Andreas: in IoT contexts having additional datasources is critical to implement use case specific business logic. That's why we have a built in mechanism to store contextual information and link back to TDs

Andreas: We support semantic data harmonization to enrich basic contextual information.

#### Natural Language Commands

Andreas: we developed a way to command different devices using an open source LLM. The model is capable of choosing the right input for different actions just by using Thing Description data.

Andreas: we can then develop an Agent framework to satisfy a certain goal.

#### Demo

Andreas: source code is [available](https://github.com/dashjoin/djapp-wot) and we have the corresponding [paper](https://github.com/dashjoin/djapp-wot/blob/main/paper.md).

> Andreas shows the ui of the demo

Andreas: voice to text support and code generation is supported. You can have dashboards too.

### Question

Ege: could you explain your process of getting to something working?

Andreas: the platform is data driven. We start by loading data. You can create tables very easily once you have data in the DB. Everything has a page (much like a semantic Wikipedia). You can customize any page. Everything can be committed to github and personalized.

Ege: Which opensource tools did you use? What are the tools and libraries that make it click?

Andreas: thanks to standards and JSON schema.

Henk: What discovery mechanism did you use? Very impressing presentation, and I can tell there were a lot of work.

Andreas: To discover a new thing I will just input the Thing Description URL. In terms of the protocols we only support the easy stuff URL and JSON.

Henk: Are you planning any "automatic loading" of TDs?

Andreas: we have a registry CSV or a north bound API.

Andreas: there are devices protected by password. We added a small extension to TD to express the role and the accounts who can use the device.

Henk: If you have 5 people with different roles, do they access to different part of the system? or they can't do some actions?

Andreas: on the database level there is a table which contains all the things and two other tables connected with Properties and Actions. We can lock different part of this table to different roles. there for we can support hiding or reviling Properties or Actions you can view and use.

Andreas: we are interested working with the community and love to hear more from you. Please use our github repository. The project is at his beginning.

Ege: any inputs for the standardization process?

Andreas: we are still working of some of the feature. But from the research perspective is semantic harmonization. It would be wonderful to use JSON-LD and semantic more to automate this process.

Vignesh: We there is something that we need to used but is not in the standard is it okay to be added in the TD?

Andreas: we ignore them, but they don't show in the UI. You can make extension of the WoT manager to use this information.

Cris: are you storing timeseries in the postgres database

Andreas: we are storing the latest value, but it is easy to change.

Cris: is it polling based?

Andreas: yes.

Ege: Interesting point. Describing which properties needs to be stored in a timeseries db could be something we can do in the specification.

Andreas: whether to keep the value or not is definitely something not device specific.

Andreas: what do think about the AI agent? For me the interesting part is that you don't have to think about different application context.

Ege: it is interesting that you showed how you can achieve a good interaction with the AI with off the shelf tools without reinviting any AI specific. Probably, in this case you can use quite small AI models to achieve good results.

Andreas: we pre process the TD before send it to the LLM.

Cris: what are the limitations?

Andreas: in complex contexts it gets messy.

Cris: are you polishing the AI output?

Andreas: currently is directly connected.

Cris: do you have some Role access control for AI agents?

Andreas: User privileges are in there but they use a different key.

Ege: Using AI prompts used in same way can help solving the data augmentation problem?

Andreas: not really, the data mapping should be very precise. But it could be a good idea.

## :ballot_box_with_check: Resolutions

None

## :exclamation: Action Items

None

## :envelope_with_arrow: Feedbacks

- Expressing role-based Authentication is not possible in the standard so we had to add ourselves
- Frequency of change of a value is relevant for timeseries
