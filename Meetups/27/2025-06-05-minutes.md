### Introduction

Ege: Welcome Everyone! we are at Meetup 27th! All slide are public
Ege: you can find us in different places on the web

### News

Ege: we do not have new meetups planned in the future but you can join the office hours to talk with us.

Ege: we have two new tutorial videos! please visit our youtube channel

Ege: there are more underway, if you are interested we are meeting every friday. You can help us with new ideas for tutorials

Ege: This year TPAC is planned in Kyoto, Japan, for 10-14 November. We are going to join as CG please let us know if you want to attend.

Ege: join the CG to keep in touch or to propose a new meetup!

### Meetup Presentation

Ege: Today we have Thomas Wehr, he is a PhD at the Chair for Technical Information Systems. In the past his department have participated in different WoT projects.

Thomas: We developed a tool to visual create WoT consumer. We wanted to create a programming environment that should portable and usable as many devices as possible. Moreover, it should be very accessible (that's why we opted for a visual programming interface). We use the Web of Things to make interoperable with many type of devices.

Thomas: visual programming in general refers to a programming environment that you arrange graphical elements to create programs (workflow, flowchart, and block based). We opted for a block based approach and we called Blast.

Thomas: we use Blockly from Google and we adapted it to Web of Things concepts

Thomas: there are many pre-defined blocks in Blockly: string operations, mathematical operations, speech to text and vice versa, http requests, etc.

Thomas: Blast has the concept of state. The main feature is to consume a Thing Description and change the device without changing any code. Blast can list only the properties available in the TD and also can validate the input/output of a block using TD data schema.

Thomas: Blast is built on top of node-wot. It worked out-of-the-box for us, but we needed a protocol binding for Bluetooth devices. The second extension that we had to do is to support "scale" and "default". The "scale" was useful for a particular device called RuuviTag and the default for a BLE LED controller. The default keyword was useful to write concise data payloads.

Thomas: let's see Blast in the action.

> Shows Blast demo
> Thomas program a Stream deck to connect with a Lamp

Thomas: to concluded that was Blast a visual programming and execution environment for WoT Consumers. It can consume TDs to dynamically to add new devices.

Thomas: we used node-wot but we extend it with a new binding and a better codec for octet streams.

### Discussion

Ege: thank you for using our open source tools!

Ege: you showed a list of devices, is pre-configured or dynamically loaded via some sort of discovery method.

Thomas: is predefined.

Ege: could you use BLE to discover Things and get their TDs from a catalog?

Thomas: yes, that would be possible.

Ege: this is similar approach to node-red, why did you choose this approach?

Thomas: Node-red is data oriented, here we have more flexibility because is a full programming language.

Cris: can you consume Thing Models? maybe they can be even used as a skeleton for program arguments

Thomas: It is possible, we are using it for some BLE devices.

Daniel: thank you for creating a new protocol binding for node-wot, we should find a way to list it somewhere. Do you have an online version of the BLAST environment?

Thomas: Yes we have it hosted online: <https://wintechis.github.io/blast/>

Ege: do you have some spec document about the binding you developed.

Thomas: we don't have a lot of documatation for that yet.

Ege: soon in the WG we'll have a way to create a document about a protocol binding. Are you interested in this activity?

Thomas: sure.

Ege: what is the difference between using BLAST in the browser or locally?

Thomas: There is not great interest to support BLE in browsers.

Ege: do you know why?

Thomas: not really...

Cris: where is the binding hosted?

Thomas: it is in our repository but the concrete implementation is split over two different "modules" one for node and the other for browser.

Cris: are you planning to move to deno?

Thomas: not yet, but we are trying to port it there.

Cris: we would be happy to know more if node-wot works out of the box there.

Ege: is there anything that would help you if it were in the standard?

Thomas: I not really sure

Ege: when you generate the UI for the inputs of the TD what is the logic are you using?

Thomas: steam deck block are statically generated
