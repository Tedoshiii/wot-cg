## :book: Minutes

### Welcome

**Ege Korkan:** welcome everyone, we will start shortly
**...** you can use irc or teams chat for queue or chatting
**...** our first speaker is here (introduces Thomas)

### Eclipse Ditto

**Thomas Jaeckle:** digital twins mean many things and ditto uses this as a basis of features
**...** ditto establishes a pattern for working with things in the iot
**...** persistance and search, authorized interactions
**...** we follow the device as a service paradigm
**...** we generally show this figure for the architecture

**Thomas Jaeckle:** iot devices are very heterogenous, ditto exposes http and websocket endpoints
**...** there are also protocols offered for event processing pipelines
**...** with ditto you turn device data into APIs
**...** you can decide how the devices send data
**...** also we have an HTTP API that looks like this on the slides

**Thomas Jaeckle:** we are using a schema less approach by default
**...** but there can be Thing Models that describe the features further

#### Device State Persistence

**Thomas Jaeckle:** iot devices are not always connected to the network
**...** but applications need constant access

#### Search

**Thomas Jaeckle:** ditto is designed to support millions of things
**...** we implement a search API using RQL

#### Ditto and WoT

**Thomas Jaeckle:** devices do not need to be aware about their TD
**...** td can be used for simulated twins
**...** you can retrofit devices easily

**Thomas Jaeckle:** we have focused on the HTTP binding
**...** we can now define schemas for our things, a huge win for us

**Thomas Jaeckle:** we can also see the semantic annotations
**...** also we hope that ditto adopters will profit from the existing tooling around WoT

**Thomas Jaeckle:** ditto downloads TMs during runtime, resolves extensions and injects forms

**Thomas Jaeckle:** once you specify the header format, you can get TDs

**Thomas Jaeckle:** we can also inject default values

#### Demo

**Thomas Jaeckle:** you can use our demo page with the ditto sandbox
**...** we have different tabs allowing you to inspect TDs and other features of the device

#### Questions

**Robert Winkler:** do you plan to rename features and attributes?

**Thomas Jaeckle:** we do not want to do that, wot can be used for describing old APIs as well

**Fady Salama:** How do you link to the physical device?

**Thomas Jaeckle:** This is abstracted. You can see the connections in the architecture

**Thomas Jaeckle:** devices can be already sending messages, for example via the ditto protocol

**Thomas Jaeckle:** this communication happens without wot knowledge

**Robert Winkler:** you are splitting information, do you model meta information as properties?

**Thomas Jaeckle:** attributes are what is not changing, so it is the metadata

**Thomas Jaeckle:** as in the example, the attributes are in the properties

**Robert Winkler:** how is the difference programmed?

**Thomas Jaeckle:** we are using the TMs and features become TMs

**Robert Winkler:** what about devices that can change capability in runtime?

**Thomas Jaeckle:** We cannot do it so easily since the version is in the TMs

**Ege Korkan:** what are examples of changing capabilities?

**Robert Winkler:** like cameras with changing storage and also sensors that can be moved to measure indoor and outdoor

### Discussion on Digital Twins

**Ege Korkan:** what about digital twins and their meaning for others?

**Fady Salama:** (introduces himself) PhD candidate at TU Munich
**...** ditto was using a shadowing approach
**...** I want to get the TD and simulate the device
**...** I think that the simulation is different from a digital twin since you need real time data from sensors and interactable
**...** digital twins need to be real time interactable
**...** so what can wot do here?
**...** we can use TDs in any simulation environment actually
**...** we are lacking a physical behavior description

**Fady Salama:** we see that a static TD is limiting sometimes

**Fady Salama:** so a TD that can change would be of interest for things like robots where the capability changes based on the position
**...** system level digital twin would need more than TDs
**...** we should also know when to embed or link information
**...** having a standardized library of TMs would be very nice as a building blocks

**Cristiano Aguzzi:** sorry for being late
**...** thank you for the presentations on the presentations of thomas and fady

**Cristiano Aguzzi:** can we describe the environment with TDs? also relevant for non digital twin questions

**Fady Salama:** the environment is not necessarily interactable like a Thing

**Cristiano Aguzzi:** if there are no property action and events, we would have a json ld document

**Ege Korkan:** what do you think thomas, about such a library of TMs?

**Thomas Jaeckle:** I think such central repositories do not work, everyone creates their own
**...** we can just link and let people maintain their own

**Robert Winkler:** it depends on the domain maybe. Matter is describing such standardized models actually. So they can be the standard in that domain

**Robert Winkler:** I am chief architect of Magenta Smart Home solution of Deutsche Telekom

**Robert Winkler:** we also have the problem that some actions depend on property values

**Ege Korkan:** do you do this in TD or code?

**Robert Winkler:** a bit of both, it would be nice to have this actually

**Cristiano Aguzzi:** do you implement discovery?

**Robert Winkler:** we use the platform protocols to discover them

**Thomas Jaeckle:** digital twin is not only simulation actually

**Ege Korkan:** yes, it became more popular to say that and now cad files of screws are digital twins... an interesting discussion nonetheless

**Cristiano Aguzzi:** robert would you like to present your solution next time? since it is using web of things

**Robert Winkler:** I need to ask for permission. How can I contact you

**Ege Korkan:** here are our emails and you can join the CG without paying etc.

**Ege Korkan:** thank you everyone for joining and really nice discussions

**Ege Korkan:** we have the next CG event schedules

**Ege Korkan:** see you all!

**Ege Korkan:** Meeting is adjourned
