## :book: Minutes
### :scroll: Agenda

### Welcome
Ege Korkan: Welcome to our 8th meetup. After presentation we will have a discussion about DT and how WoT can be used.

Ege Korkan: if you have questions use the Q&A feature

### News from the CG

Ege Korkan: We have internal meetings next one is set to be the 5th of June. We have also a YouTube channel where we post the recordings.

Ege Korkan: Next meetup is about WoT for Beginners and a new tutorial series!

### Advantages and Challenges of Web of Things for Digital Twins

Ege Korkan: Today we have 2 speakers from Schaeffler Group. Christof is an Expert Data Architect and working on different products, then we have Sven a solution architect from Schaeffler.

Christof Küstner: Advantages and challenges of WoT in building digital twin solutions.

Christof Küstner: We are working in the department of Data Science Solutions.

Christof Küstner: Schaeffler produces metal parts and mechatronics systems. Most known product is bearings (small and large scale). Everything that is rotating have a Schaeffler product in it.

Christof Küstner: we are distributed world wide with more than 83.000 employees. Revenue 15.8 billions, we registered 1250 patents in 2022. We are trying to be innovative and invest in R&D.

Christof Küstner: When it comes to Digital Twin (DT) you hear a lot of buzzwords. Each department/expert have its own opinion about what a DT is really is.

Christof Küstner: We have a product-centric view to increase the revenue and/or reduce the cost. For us is a digital representation of a physical thing.

Christof Küstner: Imagine to map everything you know about the product in the cloud. Like a network connected with the physical world. We want to have each product produced represented in the cloud. This way we have track of everything about it. If there are sensors attach we want to also interact with the sensors. WoT was our choice because it maps well our goal to represent our products in the digital world (properties, actions, event).

Christof Küstner: Our most advanced bearings have sensors attached (load, speed, etc.).

Christof Küstner: In the beginning it works very well. We ship the data to the customer together with the product. We used WoT standard. The final customer was able to interact with our product.

Christof Küstner: we had a data integration layer where we ingested data and standardized its representation.

Christof Küstner: We exposed a rest api following WoT standard.

Sven Pelzer: similar products, customer wants to search about properties. Also, a lot of properties are the same across different bearings, just the ID changes. We have a lot of properties but similar to each single product.

Sven Pelzer: We have fixed values but different ids. Millions of elements with the same physical properties but different IDs.

Sven Pelzer: Our customers don't use Thing Description. What is the benefit of using Thing Description instead of Swagger? We build a conversion tool.

#### Q&A Session

Philipp Blum: Is this Java WoT library open source, or do you plan to open source it?

Sven Pelzer: not yet, maybe in the future.

Ege Korkan: nice presentation. Thank you for sharing the challenges.

Christian Glomb: Your companies build bearings and at the same time you describe those TDs. What is the lifecycle of these TDs?

Sven Pelzer: We attach a TD afterwards. The business decide which properties to publish. In the future we are trying to automate.

Christof Küstner: there is governance involved.

Christian : do you have anything else beside properties?

Sven Pelzer: No events, no actions.

Christof Küstner: there is a big overhead, nobody wants to interact with the remote thing.

Sven Pelzer: const valued are stored in a DB.

*Ch shows an example of data slide 20*

Sven Pelzer: this api is not really used by our customers

Cristiano Aguzzi: is it possible to move some of this static information directly to the TD itself?

Sven Pelzer: There is a lot of dynamic cases, we personalize our products to the customer needs.

Philipp Blum: Regarding the search. Did you try to use SPARQL for that purpose?

Christof Küstner: have you tried a semantic database with millions of even more? it cannot handle our use case.

Pedram Hadjian: same experience with the semantic database. Storing the data in the DB and then represent it with the TD is right. But you are not forced to TD. If you have the data in a normalized format you can go DB, but with sensors make sense to have a TD. It depends from the use case but SPARQL is bad. GraphQL is used to do geo queries.

Christof Küstner: what we wish in the future is the machine is able to interact locally with the product via the standard. We have also a digital product catalog based on WoT too. Get data digitally.

Sven Pelzer: is not WoT actually. But the workflow is similar

Pedram Hadjian: Do you have collaboration with customers that want to implement some machine learning workflow?

Sven Pelzer: not really, we have only the use cased presented today. We do not offer sensor data. We offer product data.

Christof Küstner: no customer required.

Pedram Hadjian: which protocol do you use to probe the sensors?

Sven Pelzer: it depends on the customer that assemble the wind turbine or other machine.

Pedram Hadjian: there is a lot of variations in our industry, but embed a TD can help.

Ege Korkan: there is tool that does the conversion between TD and Swagger.

Sven Pelzer: nice. We have a internal tool.

Ege Korkan: if you use the TM we can do something.

Sven Pelzer: we create a different view of the same TD for different customers. for legal reasons.

Ege Korkan: any other questions?

Ege Korkan: how is teaching WoT to your customers?

Sven Pelzer: we make some meetings with the dev team. The fact that is json is helpful.

Pedram Hadjian: we want to enable people work on IoT data with open source initiative.

Ege Korkan: Have you used Thing Models?

Sven Pelzer: not right now. The user requirements were pressing and we didn't have time to look into it.

Ege Korkan: you started using WoT 2 years ago?

Sven Pelzer: yes

Ege Korkan: quite early. At the time did you considered other stuff? how was the decision process?

Christof Küstner: We browsed different solutions and one of the criteria was also how easy it was to digest the docs or the spec. WoT was very close to our way of thinking. It was also mature enough for us to use. Om was useful for interacting. Human and machine readability was important. We didn't know if at one point humans were involved in the loop.

#### Digital Twins discussion

Ege Korkan: do you see wot to have an issue of handling live data from the factory?

Christof Küstner: Had some experience in the past but I not sure.

Sven Pelzer: Currently, we are not planning to do it. We don't have live data. If we have we are getting it from 3rd parties. We consume data.

Christof Küstner: Our customers ask for analysis.

Ege Korkan: Feature wishes to the standard?

Sven Pelzer: Access level mapping could be cool. We are in discussion with CatenaX. Our use case property level access.

Christof Küstner: I like Pedram idea of having open source. Would speed up everything.

Pedram Hadjian: The magic happens when you can write script and everything works. We will start from that. We have server API side. We need an open source IDE.

Cristiano Aguzzi: Which tech are using?

Sven Pelzer: Java and windows servers

Cristiano Aguzzi: Can you use TDs to kind of harness variability in user data?

Sven Pelzer: Consuming user data is always done in MVPs and we don't have a product.

#### Wrap up

Ege Korkan: thank you for the presentation, if you want to stay in touch you can use our resources online.

Ege Korkan: we will see in two weeks with the next meetup.
