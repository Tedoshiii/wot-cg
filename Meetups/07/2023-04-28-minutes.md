### Welcome

Cristiano Aguzzi: Welcome everyone!
Cristiano Aguzzi: We are more active in the web recently.
Cristiano Aguzzi: 

### News from the CG

Cristiano Aguzzi: You can join our internal meetings, our office hours

### Web Scale Agents with WoT and No-Code Applications in IoT

Cristiano Aguzzi: Today we welcome Simon Mayer

... Simon is Professor of Interaction- and Communication-based Systems at the University of St.Gallen. Together with his research group (https://interactions.ics.unisg.ch/ ), he explores interactions among devices and people in ubiquitous computing environments.

... he is a seasoned WoT expert, here since the beginning

Simon Mayer: Thank you. It was difficult to sum up everything!

Simon Mayer: There are other people involved in this through the IntellIoT project.

Simon Mayer: This has been a nice interoperability journey

Simon Mayer: I am a fan of runtime decision systems

Simon Mayer: today I will be focusing on autonomous systems

#### IntellIoT

Simon Mayer: we are a group of partners and our part was to bring agents systems in industrial environments

Simon Mayer: We have deployed two use cases and want

#### Agriculture Use Case

Simon Mayer: An agent can drive a tractor that has TDs in it. It gets position information

Simon Mayer: the agent create artifacts like a TD, and they can be discovered in runtime

Simon Mayer: And we enable domain experts to use no-code environments

Simon Mayer: An operator can give a goal like "harvest field 5" and the agent can drive the tractor to do it

#### Industrial Use Case

Simon Mayer: An agent can control robot to grab wood plates to engrave them

Simon Mayer: The robot, engraver, etc. have all TDs.

### FIND TOPIC

#### Yggdrasil

Simon Mayer: we have devices that register their TDs to our platform. Our environment can configure the agents who then speak with the Things

Simon Mayer: in the center of the architecture, we have the Yggdrasil platform

Simon Mayer: only recently we have started considering the Web. This brings interesting challenges, like agent experts finding Web too chaotic.

Simon Mayer: We generate an RDF representation of the hypermedia environment

Simon Mayer: This can be a proposal blueprint to use agents in WoT

#### No Code Development

Simon Mayer: Our functional blocks are created based on TDs

... it allows to configure agents.

Simon Mayer: The IDE fetches TDs from Yggdrasil

Simon Mayer: The agent abstraction is better for programing 

Simon Mayer: Bindings are resolved in runtime and this can be a way for Agents creation by WoT

#### TD Negotiation

Simon Mayer: our goal is to have TDs as late as possible

... so that we can optimize everything

Simon Mayer: There are non functional requirements like security that can be changed in run time

#### Journaling

Simon Mayer: How to record what is happening in runtime 

#### Affordance Theory

Simon Mayer: we want to use signifiers


### Wrap Up

Simon Mayer: WoT is a good fit for achieving interoperability since it is very flexible

#### Questions and Answers

Ege Korkan: is Yggdrasil a TDD?

Simon Mayer: yes. It is WoT Hive in the background with some additional. Agents also have TDs that describe the interfaces. It also runs the agents as well.

Cristiano Aguzzi: Journaling can be used to optimize the interactions?

Simon Mayer: There can be lots that can be done with this. Our partners were thinking of auditing use cases, like legal implications.

Simon Mayer: it would be nice to include payments as well.

Cristiano Aguzzi: We have used docker containers but it was abstracting a bit too much

Cristiano Aguzzi: payments were a bit difficult since you have too much delay there.

Simon Mayer: I am really interested in TD negotiation. We design based on what we are expecting. Then we can decouple things quite a lot.

Ege Korkan: do you use node-wot to do with

Simon Mayer: yes. we have extended a bit. We had partners having issues creating TDs.

... none of our partners created TDs, they sent us YAMLs and we had to create them.

... we need more authoring tools for TDs. It was a bit frustrating.

Ege Korkan: what is difficult to create TDs?

Simon Mayer: it is not the software and tooling that is missing... It is people being used to one technology or not.

Ege Korkan: what is the range of negotiation for TDs?

Simon Mayer: function has to be exposed. I want this in design and engineering time. I typically need to bind to input parameters. This way I can have 

mm: What about events. interaction started by Things like notifications. How does you system manage it?

Simon Mayer: we use it in our escalation system where the Thing notifies to the AI system and that sends to the Human when needed.

... essentially via callbacks.
