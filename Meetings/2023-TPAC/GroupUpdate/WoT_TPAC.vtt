00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.125 
Hello, welcome to the introduction video of Web of Things by the W3C WoT Community Group.

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:15.528 
Since you came across this video, we assume that you heard a bit about

00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:20.932 
the Web of Things and Thing Description. But let us give a brief introduction.

00:00:20.932 --> 00:00:25.693 
First, let's talk about the difference between IoT and WoT.

00:00:25.693 --> 00:00:33.747 
While IoT focuses on technologies for connecting devices to the Internet, WoT leverages IoT and aims

00:00:33.747 --> 00:00:41.801 
to provide interoperability between Things using established architectural ideas for the Web and web technologies.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:46.731 
So lets talk about a Thing and Thing Description.

00:00:46.731 --> 00:00:52.279 
In the WoT Architecture, a Thing is defined as an abstraction of an

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:57.827 
IoT device or service. And TD provides descriptive metadata for a Thing.

00:00:57.827 --> 00:01:03.764 
WoT provides a set of standardized technology building blocks that help to

00:01:03.764 --> 00:01:09.700 
streamline IoT application development by following the well-known and successful Web paradigm.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.378 
With the architecture enabled by the Web of Things, flexibility and interoperability increases, especially

00:01:17.378 --> 00:01:25.056 
in cross-domain applications, as well as enabling the reuse of established standards and tools.

00:01:25.056 --> 00:01:31.771 
If you want to learn more, we are developing a tutorial series called “What is WoT?”

00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:40.173 
Throughout this tutorial series, we will explain the Web of Things, its applications and tools for newcomers.

00:01:41.706 --> 00:01:47.377 
We have a website and videos to learn WoT and speed up the learning process.

00:01:47.377 --> 00:01:51.833 
Each video is short, so you can learn WoT bit by bit or

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:56.289 
you can follow the tutorial on our website in your own pace.

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:00.990 
At any time, you can come back and use the tutorial as a reference.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.410 
This tutorial series is not only consisting of material to read and watch, but is

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.831 
also supported with code snippets that you can work on and try by yourself.

00:02:11.831 --> 00:02:17.708 
At the end of the series, you will have all the tools in your belt to build WoT applications.

00:02:17.708 --> 00:02:22.603 
With all these tools, you can build actual software such as dashboards,

00:02:22.603 --> 00:02:26.915 
protocol proxies and translators,

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:30.230 
smart internet-connected devices,

00:02:30.234 --> 00:02:34.303 
mash ups of WoT devices and services,

00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:38.348 
in many domains such as Smart Homes,

00:02:38.348 --> 00:02:41.762 
and Factory Automation.

00:02:43.368 --> 00:02:49.608 
What can be achieved with the WoT is endless. We feel your excitement to learn and develop

00:02:49.608 --> 00:02:55.848 
the WoT applications. If you are ready to dive into world of WoT, let's start this journey!

00:02:55.848 --> 00:03:01.495 
For the rest of the series, make sure to follow the W3C WoT Community Group,

00:03:01.495 --> 00:03:05.321 
And we have multiple options to stay in touch:

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:08.820 
You can join the Discord server.

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:15.693 
You can find how companies use WoT via the presentations on the YouTube channel.

00:03:15.693 --> 00:03:21.279 
Also you can join one of the office hours happening every Thursday.

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:26.791 
You can visit w3 dot org/wot to learn more about WoT. If

00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:32.302 
you want to contribute you can join WoT community group too.
