### Hands-on Tutorial

Michael McCool: Do you have another scenario to share besides the one in the tutorial?

Cristiano Aguzzi: In node-wot, there are other scenarios like the counter sample, see https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot/blob/master/examples/scripts/counter-client.js

Daniel Peintner: FYI: There are other examples on node-wot as well, see https://github.com/eclipse-thingweb/node-wot/tree/master/

Michael McCool: Long-running actions and how to handle that (w.r.t. coffee brewing)?

Cristiano Aguzzi: Correct, async response for brewing coffee (it takes some time).

Michael McCool: Or use event once the coffee is done would be possible too.

### Q&A

Robert Winkler: Is there a tool to generate TS files out of TD?

Cristiano Aguzzi: Good point. Nothing right now. Typing "could" probably be improved and mistyping will show up ("bruw" vs. "brew").

Michael McCool: No need to use node-wot for automation. node-wot is just an example in TS/JS. Other languages are possible. Automation can be done differently. Question "what is the best way to describe automation".

Robert Winkler: We developed a rule engine. Standardization might be great.

Ege Korkan: Rule engine open source?

Robert Winkler: Unfortunately not

Michael McCool: Yaml sounds promising 

Michael McCool: Home assistant has done a lot of work with  NodeRED

Luca Barbato: WoT is missing ontologies?

Michael McCool: In different automation systems syntax differs, but structure is common across them

Luca Barbato: Need to find good ontology that matches the rule system

Michael McCool: We have good models to follow w.r.t. automation.
