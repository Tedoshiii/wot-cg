# Video Workflow

A typical "What is WoT?" tutorial video follows the steps below. The product of each step is reviewed before proceeding to the next. This process is replicated via a GitHub project at <https://github.com/orgs/w3c/projects/58/views/1>.

1. A table of contents for the video is created.
2. A text file (the script) is created that will later be the voice-over text. This is the easiest to review over GitHub and should be the main point of discussion for the content of the video.
2. The script is turned into an animation within a slideset in Powerpoint with all the visual and spoken text elements present.
3. The animation is imported into the voiceover generation tool where the following is done:
   1. The text from each slide is imported
   2. The voiceover is generated
   3. Time synchronization happens manually. This can involve tweaks to the animation.
   4. Background music is added
4. The video is shared via a link to enable easy review without requiring to upload the video for each change requested.
5. The video is uploaded to GitHub with the following content:
  1. Video file
  2. VTT subtitle file
  3. Video description
  4. License Code for Background Music
  5. Thumbnail
7. Final review happens
8. Video is uploaded to YouTube. Sometimes we do the upload of multiple videos in one batch
