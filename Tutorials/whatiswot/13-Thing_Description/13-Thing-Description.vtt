00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.941 
 In this video, we will provide a general overview of a fundamental concept in the Web of Things —

00:00:07.941 --> 00:00:10.150 
the Thing Description, or TD.

00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:18.971 
 A TD acts as a unique blueprint for the respective Thing, offering a standardized way to describe its functionality

00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:21.192 
and how a Consumer should interact with it.

00:00:21.585 --> 00:00:29.595 
 A Consumer is any application or service that communicates with a Thing over the network using its Thing Description.

00:00:29.595 --> 00:00:33.453 
It understands the TD and uses it to interact with the Thing.

00:00:33.897 --> 00:00:41.841 
 Thing Descriptions are written using the JSON-LD format, making it both machine and human-readable.

00:00:42.281 --> 00:00:49.525 
 To understand this better, let's take a look at a simple example — a smart coffee machine — and

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:52.187 
break down the components in its Thing Description:

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:01.600 
 The Thing Description begins with the Thing's metadata. It provides the essential information about the device, like its unique

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.972 
ID, title, and description.

00:01:04.451 --> 00:01:13.820 
 Then, in the definitions of Interaction Affordances, we specify ways a Consumer application can interact with the Thing, through

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.152 
its various properties, actions, and events exposed on its network interfaces.

00:01:19.152 --> 00:01:28.022 
The example here shows the property `coffeeBeansLeft`, which describes the current state of the coffee beans; the action `brewCoffee`, which

00:01:28.022 --> 00:01:34.457 
triggers brewing; and the event `lowOnWater`, which alerts the Consumer when the machine is low on water.

00:01:34.457 --> 00:01:40.323 
We’ll explore Interaction Affordances in greater detail in the next video of this series.

00:01:41.741 --> 00:01:51.550 
 The Security Metadata defines security mechanisms required to ensure secure access to the Thing by the Consumer application. This

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:57.591 
way the Consumer application knows what type of credentials are needed to execute different operations.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:06.358 
 To add keywords that are not part of the TD standard, we can add Semantic Annotations. These allow other

00:02:06.358 --> 00:02:14.821 
systems to consistently interpret the device’s terms and functions. Here, we annotate using schema org to add the name of

00:02:14.821 --> 00:02:19.074 
the manufacturer, which is not part of the core TD specification.

00:02:19.536 --> 00:02:27.027 
 Finally, we can link the Thing Description to other documents, such as documentation or a user interface.

00:02:27.501 --> 00:02:34.443 
 This overview should give you a solid foundation for understanding the role of Thing Descriptions in the Web of

00:02:34.443 --> 00:02:34.934 
Things.

00:02:35.408 --> 00:02:39.935 
 The next videos will explain the components in greater detail.
