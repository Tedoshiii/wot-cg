00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.534 
 In this video, we will provide a general overview of a fundamental concept in the Web of Things —

00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:09.570 
the Thing Description, or TD.

00:00:10.032 --> 00:00:18.402 
 A TD acts as a unique blueprint for the respective Thing, offering a standardized way to describe its functionality

00:00:18.402 --> 00:00:20.623 
and how a Consumer should interact with it.

00:00:21.015 --> 00:00:29.025 
 A Consumer is any application or service that communicates with a Thing over the network using its Thing Description.

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.883 
It understands the TD and uses it to interact with the Thing.

00:00:33.327 --> 00:00:41.271 
 Thing Descriptions are written using the JSON-LD format, making it both machine and human-readable.

00:00:41.711 --> 00:00:48.955 
 To understand this better, let's take a look at a simple example — a smart coffee machine — and

00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:51.617 
break down the components in its Thing Description:

00:00:52.079 --> 00:01:01.146 
 The Thing Description begins with the Thing's metadata. It provides the essential information about the device, like its unique

00:01:01.146 --> 00:01:03.483 
ID, title, and description.

00:01:03.963 --> 00:01:13.332 
 Then, in the definitions of Interaction Affordances, we specify ways a Consumer application can interact with the Thing, through

00:01:13.332 --> 00:01:18.664 
its various properties, actions, and events exposed on its network interfaces.

00:01:18.664 --> 00:01:27.534 
The example here shows the property `coffeeBeansLeft`, which describes the current state of the coffee beans; the action `brewCoffee`, which

00:01:27.534 --> 00:01:33.969 
triggers brewing; and the event `lowOnWater`, which alerts the Consumer when the machine is low on water.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.835 
We’ll explore Interaction Affordances in greater detail in the next video of this series.

00:01:41.253 --> 00:01:50.390 
 The Security Metadata defines security mechanisms required to ensure authorized and secure interactions with the Thing by the Consumer

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:59.735 
application. This way the Consumer application knows what type of credentials are needed to execute different operations, like the `brewCoffee`

00:01:59.735 --> 00:02:01.062 
action we see here.

00:02:01.529 --> 00:02:09.817 
 To add keywords that are not part of the TD standard, we can add Semantic Annotations. These allow other

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:18.280 
systems to consistently interpret the device’s terms and functions. Here, we annotate using schema org to add the name of

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.533 
the manufacturer, which is not part of the core TD specification.

00:02:22.995 --> 00:02:30.486 
 Finally, we can link the Thing Description to other documents, such as documentation or a user interface.

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.902 
 This overview should give you a solid foundation for understanding the role of Thing Descriptions in the Web of

00:02:37.902 --> 00:02:38.393 
Things.

00:02:38.867 --> 00:02:43.394 
 The next videos will explain the components in greater detail.
