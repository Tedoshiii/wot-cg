00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.334 
Over the course of the next two videos, we will introduce the W3C Web of Things by exploring its application

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:17.416 
domains and common architecture patterns. In this video, our focus will be Smart Homes and Smart Cities.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:26.389 
In smart homes, the ability to connect and manage multiple assets remotely over the network is highly beneficial.

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:34.092 
The interesting aspect of smart homes isn’t tied to a specific solution you buy, but rather in how WoT enables

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:35.487 
flexibility.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:45.514 
Manufacturers can provide Thing Descriptions (TDs) for their devices, which lets anyone build and customize their own systems.

00:00:45.514 --> 00:00:54.052 
By following these open standards, devices can communicate with each other across brands, allowing for seamless integration.

00:00:54.052 --> 00:01:02.620 
This approach ensures that devices remain adaptable and private, and don’t become obsolete, as they can continuously support new use

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.645 
cases and technologies.

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:11.832 
Now that we’ve covered the basics of smart homes, let’s take a closer look at the architecture patterns that enable

00:01:11.832 --> 00:01:17.817 
these systems to work efficiently in a typical local network and remote-control scenario.

00:01:17.817 --> 00:01:25.758 
A common pattern involves using a controller, locally and or remotely, to interact with devices on the home network by

00:01:25.758 --> 00:01:27.935 
consuming the Thing Description.

00:01:27.935 --> 00:01:36.746 
Devices are represented by TDs and act as servers, responding to commands from client controllers (for example smartphones) for actions

00:01:36.746 --> 00:01:40.996 
such as adjusting settings or activating sensors.

00:01:40.997 --> 00:01:45.890 
Gateways are another pattern commonly found in Smart Homes.

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:52.537 
Gateways connect home networks to the internet, enabling remote management and monitoring.

00:01:52.537 --> 00:02:00.240 
They can use the local TD of a device and provide web-level access management, allowing devices to be accessed and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.559 
managed both locally and remotely over the web.

00:02:03.559 --> 00:02:12.556 
In the local network, the device uses one protocol for control, while externally, another protocol is typically used to manage

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:14.375 
remote interactions.

00:02:14.375 --> 00:02:23.655 
The gateways facilitate communication between local devices and external controllers, enhancing accessibility and control.

00:02:23.656 --> 00:02:33.350 
Smart buildings such as offices, schools, government facilities, shops and hotels are the next important step towards building a smart

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:40.304 
city. Unlike homes, the Things are owned and managed by the building owner rather than the individuals, who just control

00:02:40.304 --> 00:02:41.506 
them.

00:02:41.506 --> 00:02:49.273 
The features of these buildings mainly focus on comfort - like proper airflow, and safety - fire alarms and security

00:02:49.273 --> 00:02:50.427 
systems.

00:02:50.428 --> 00:02:58.462 
They often use protocols like BACnet, Modbus, and KNX for local control, which are not typical in a smart home.

00:02:58.462 --> 00:03:05.403 
WoT can enhance interoperability, allowing different systems to work together more seamlessly.

00:03:05.403 --> 00:03:13.727 
Since a smart city consists of many smart buildings and additional infrastructure, smart buildings are a crucial step toward scaling

00:03:13.727 --> 00:03:16.961 
up to a fully connected city.

00:03:16.962 --> 00:03:29.658 
In smart cities, WoT's domain-agnostic nature enables scalability across various municipal systems, making it more flexible than traditional IoT solutions.

00:03:29.658 --> 00:03:38.690 
WoT's ability to seamlessly integrate different domains — such as water management, air quality monitoring, and traffic control — makes

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.737 
it a perfect fit for urban environments.

00:03:41.737 --> 00:03:51.512 
WoT leverages open standards like Thing Descriptions (TDs) and built-in web protocols in addition to traditional IoT protocols and this

00:03:51.512 --> 00:03:56.289 
allows devices from different systems and manufacturers to communicate.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:04.951 
This flexibility ensures smart cities can scale as needed, adding new devices and systems without being tied to a single

00:04:04.951 --> 00:04:06.779 
vendor or technology.

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:17.077 
Multi-ownership also becomes an option — different organisations or managers oversee different Things, while WoT ensures seamless interoperability across all

00:04:17.077 --> 00:04:17.906 
of them.

00:04:17.907 --> 00:04:28.123 
Additionally, WoT's use of open standards supports a wide range of protocols, making it adaptable to various architectures, whether client-server

00:04:28.123 --> 00:04:37.910 
or publish-subscribe, with or without cloud involvement. This versatility allows smart cities to choose the best approach for their infrastructure.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:47.093 
In addition to this and the upcoming video, the WoT Architecture document contains many more domain-specific examples beyond the ones

00:04:47.093 --> 00:04:49.049 
covered in these videos.
