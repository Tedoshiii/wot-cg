00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.334 
Over the course of the next two videos, we will introduce the W3C Web of Things by exploring its application

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:17.416 
domains and common architecture patterns. In this video, our focus will be Smart Homes and Smart Cities.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:26.389 
In smart homes, the ability to connect and manage multiple assets remotely over the network is highly beneficial.

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:34.092 
The interesting aspect of smart homes isn’t tied to a specific solution you buy, but rather in how WoT enables

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:35.487 
flexibility.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.488 
A Manufacturer can provide a Thing Description (or TD for short) for their device, which lets anyone build and customize

00:00:43.488 --> 00:00:45.177 
their own systems.

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:53.715 
By following these open standards, devices can communicate with each other across brands, allowing for seamless integration.

00:00:53.716 --> 00:01:02.284 
This approach ensures that devices remain adaptable and private, and don’t become obsolete, as they can continuously support new use

00:01:02.284 --> 00:01:04.309 
cases and technologies.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:11.495 
Now that we’ve covered the basics of smart homes, let’s take a closer look at the architecture patterns that enable

00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:17.480 
these systems to work efficiently in a typical local network and remote-control scenario.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:25.421 
A common pattern involves using a controller, locally and or remotely, to interact with devices on the home network by

00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:27.598 
consuming the Thing Description.

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:37.293 
Devices are represented by TDs and act as servers, responding to commands from client controllers (for example, smartphones) for actions

00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:41.591 
such as reading sensor values or activating devices.

00:01:41.591 --> 00:01:46.484 
Gateways are another pattern commonly found in Smart Homes.

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:53.131 
Gateways connect home networks to the internet, enabling remote management and monitoring.

00:01:53.131 --> 00:02:00.895 
A gateway can use the local TD of a device to provide web-level access management, allowing devices to be accessed

00:02:00.895 --> 00:02:04.527 
and managed both locally and remotely over the web.

00:02:04.527 --> 00:02:13.524 
In the local network, the device uses one protocol for control, while externally, another protocol is typically used to manage

00:02:13.524 --> 00:02:15.343 
remote interactions.

00:02:15.343 --> 00:02:24.623 
The gateways facilitate communication between local devices and external controllers, enhancing accessibility and control.

00:02:24.625 --> 00:02:34.191 
Smart buildings such as offices, schools, government facilities, shops, and hotels are the next important step towards building a smart

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:41.029 
city. Unlike homes, the Things are owned and managed by the building owner, rather than by the individuals who just

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:42.742 
control them.

00:02:42.742 --> 00:02:50.125 
The features of these buildings mainly focus on comfort — like proper airflow — and safety — like fire alarms

00:02:50.125 --> 00:02:52.023 
and security systems.

00:02:52.023 --> 00:03:00.057 
They often use protocols like BACnet, Modbus, and KNX for local control, which are not typical in a smart home.

00:03:00.057 --> 00:03:06.998 
WoT can enhance interoperability, allowing different systems to work together more seamlessly.

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:15.323 
Since a smart city consists of many smart buildings and additional infrastructure, smart buildings are a crucial step toward scaling

00:03:15.323 --> 00:03:18.557 
up to a fully connected city.

00:03:18.557 --> 00:03:29.992 
In a smart city, WoT's domain-agnostic nature enables scalability across various municipal systems, making it more flexible than traditional IoT

00:03:29.992 --> 00:03:31.206 
solutions.

00:03:31.207 --> 00:03:40.471 
WoT's ability to seamlessly integrate different domains - such as water management, air quality monitoring, and traffic control — makes

00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:43.599 
it a perfect fit for urban environments.

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:52.909 
WoT leverages open standards like Thing Descriptions and built-in web protocols in addition to traditional IoT protocols. This allows devices

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.030 
from different systems and manufacturers to communicate.

00:03:57.032 --> 00:04:05.379 
This flexibility ensures that smart cities can scale as needed, adding new devices and systems without being tied to a

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.660 
single vendor or technology.

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:17.958 
Multi-ownership also becomes an option — different organisations or managers oversee different Things, while WoT ensures seamless interoperability across all

00:04:17.958 --> 00:04:18.787 
of them.

00:04:18.788 --> 00:04:29.004 
Additionally, WoT's use of open standards supports a wide range of protocols, making it adaptable to various architectures, whether client-server

00:04:29.004 --> 00:04:38.791 
or publish-subscribe, with or without cloud involvement. This versatility allows smart cities to choose the best approach for their infrastructure.

00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:48.090 
In addition to this and the upcoming video, the WoT Architecture document contains many domain-specific examples beyond the ones covered

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.640 
in these videos.
