00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.334 
Over the course of the next two videos, we will introduce the W3C Web of Things by exploring its application

00:00:09.334 --> 00:00:17.416 
domains and common architecture patterns. In this video, our focus will be Smart Homes and Smart Cities.

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:26.389 
In smart homes, the ability to connect and manage multiple assets remotely over the network is highly beneficial.

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:34.092 
The interesting aspect of smart homes isn’t tied to a specific solution you buy, but rather in how WoT enables

00:00:34.092 --> 00:00:35.487 
flexibility.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:44.620 
A Manufacturer can provide a Thing Description (TD) for their device, which lets anyone build and customize their own systems.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:53.158 
By following these open standards, devices can communicate with each other across brands, allowing for seamless integration.

00:00:53.158 --> 00:01:01.726 
This approach ensures that devices remain adaptable and private, and don’t become obsolete, as they can continuously support new use

00:01:01.726 --> 00:01:03.751 
cases and technologies.

00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:10.938 
Now that we’ve covered the basics of smart homes, let’s take a closer look at the architecture patterns that enable

00:01:10.938 --> 00:01:16.923 
these systems to work efficiently in a typical local network and remote-control scenario.

00:01:16.923 --> 00:01:24.864 
A common pattern involves using a controller, locally and or remotely, to interact with devices on the home network by

00:01:24.864 --> 00:01:27.041 
consuming the Thing Description.

00:01:27.041 --> 00:01:36.445 
Devices are represented by TDs and act as servers, responding to commands from client controllers (for example, smartphones) for actions

00:01:36.445 --> 00:01:40.555 
such as adjusting settings or activating sensors.

00:01:40.556 --> 00:01:45.449 
Gateways are another pattern commonly found in Smart Homes.

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:52.095 
Gateways connect home networks to the internet, enabling remote management and monitoring.

00:01:52.096 --> 00:01:59.860 
A gateway can use the local TD of a device to provide web-level access management, allowing devices to be accessed

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.492 
and managed both locally and remotely over the web.

00:02:03.492 --> 00:02:12.489 
In the local network, the device uses one protocol for control, while externally, another protocol is typically used to manage

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.308 
remote interactions.

00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:23.588 
The gateways facilitate communication between local devices and external controllers, enhancing accessibility and control.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:33.156 
Smart buildings such as offices, schools, government facilities, shops, and hotels are the next important step towards building a smart

00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:39.994 
city. Unlike homes, the Things are owned and managed by the building owner, rather than by the individuals who just

00:02:39.994 --> 00:02:41.707 
control them.

00:02:41.707 --> 00:02:49.090 
The features of these buildings mainly focus on comfort — like proper airflow — and safety — like fire alarms

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.988 
and security systems.

00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:59.022 
They often use protocols like BACnet, Modbus, and KNX for local control, which are not typical in a smart home.

00:02:59.022 --> 00:03:05.963 
WoT can enhance interoperability, allowing different systems to work together more seamlessly.

00:03:05.964 --> 00:03:14.288 
Since a smart city consists of many smart buildings and additional infrastructure, smart buildings are a crucial step toward scaling

00:03:14.288 --> 00:03:17.522 
up to a fully connected city.

00:03:17.522 --> 00:03:28.957 
In a smart city, WoT's domain-agnostic nature enables scalability across various municipal systems, making it more flexible than traditional IoT

00:03:28.957 --> 00:03:30.171 
solutions.

00:03:30.172 --> 00:03:39.436 
WoT's ability to seamlessly integrate different domains - such as water management, air quality monitoring, and traffic control — makes

00:03:39.436 --> 00:03:42.564 
it a perfect fit for urban environments.

00:03:42.564 --> 00:03:52.002 
WoT leverages open standards like Thing Descriptions (TDs) and built-in web protocols in addition to traditional IoT protocols. This allows

00:03:52.002 --> 00:03:56.715 
devices from different systems and manufacturers to communicate.

00:03:56.716 --> 00:04:05.063 
This flexibility ensures that smart cities can scale as needed, adding new devices and systems without being tied to a

00:04:05.063 --> 00:04:07.344 
single vendor or technology.

00:04:07.344 --> 00:04:17.642 
Multi-ownership also becomes an option — different organisations or managers oversee different Things, while WoT ensures seamless interoperability across all

00:04:17.642 --> 00:04:18.471 
of them.

00:04:18.473 --> 00:04:28.689 
Additionally, WoT's use of open standards supports a wide range of protocols, making it adaptable to various architectures, whether client-server

00:04:28.689 --> 00:04:38.476 
or publish-subscribe, with or without cloud involvement. This versatility allows smart cities to choose the best approach for their infrastructure.

00:04:38.476 --> 00:04:47.775 
In addition to this and the upcoming video, the WoT Architecture document contains many domain-specific examples beyond the ones covered

00:04:47.775 --> 00:04:49.325 
in these videos.
