## Title

OSI Layers & Network Topologies | What is WoT

## Description

In WoT we are dealing with interacting with devices over the network. Thus, we need to look at how such a communication is modelled.
The WoT focuses on the protocols that operate on the application layer that use TCP and UDP from the transport layer. Thus, it is important to understand OSI layers and how sending and receiving data works.
