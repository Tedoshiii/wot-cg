00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.493 
 The Web of Things finds applications in diverse fields beyond smart homes and cities, with industrial and agriculture systems

00:00:11.493 --> 00:00:14.106 
being two major and complex examples.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.763 
 Let's first take a look at industrial systems.

00:00:20.237 --> 00:00:30.743 
 Industrial applications often resemble smart home scenarios, but come with broader and more demanding requirements. These include advanced monitoring

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:36.563 
of connected manufacturing equipment, tracking products and predicting possible machine failures.

00:00:37.053 --> 00:00:43.662 
 In factories, for example, devices from multiple manufacturers must work together seamlessly.

00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:54.540 
WoT simplifies this by supporting a range of industrial protocols such as Modbus, Profinet, OPC UA, and MQTT, including legacy

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.136 
ones.

00:00:55.136 --> 00:01:02.163 
Each device is described using a Thing Description, which tells other systems exactly how to interact with it.

00:01:02.163 --> 00:01:10.641 
This reduces complexity and engineering effort without introducing overhead or security concerns - TDs enhance existing workflows.

00:01:12.444 --> 00:01:20.245 
 TDs also enable a new way to build application logic - whether it's control logic, business logic or mashups

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:30.996 
- using simple files instead of being locked into proprietary systems. This decouples devices from vendor-specific applications, offering flexibility and

00:01:30.996 --> 00:01:32.776 
long-term maintainability.

00:01:33.247 --> 00:01:41.257 
 With TDs, we can add context to the system by including annotations from domain models, providing more meaning to

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:43.862 
how devices are used within their environment.

00:01:44.265 --> 00:01:50.619 
 Moving on to another domain-specific application of WoT â€” agriculture systems.

00:01:51.104 --> 00:02:01.436 
 Agriculture offers a wide range of automation possibilities, from monitoring soil moisture and automating watering, to handling fertilization schedules

00:02:01.436 --> 00:02:02.880 
and machinery operation.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:13.127 
However, finding a single solution that fits all needs is challenging, especially for small and medium-sized farms. These farmers often

00:02:13.127 --> 00:02:21.648 
aim to automate just one specific task, like soil monitoring, for example. WoT plays a crucial role as an interoperable

00:02:21.648 --> 00:02:30.552 
interface here, allowing these farmers to integrate only the parts they need without committing to an all-encompassing solution. By enabling

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:38.900 
flexibility and compatibility across different devices and systems, WoT makes it easier for farms to adopt new solutions at their

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.180 
own pace and budget.

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.583 
 Agriculture systems also come with their own set of constraints.

00:02:44.583 --> 00:02:50.658 
Often, devices in agricultural environments are constrained in terms of power and connectivity.

00:02:50.658 --> 00:02:58.184 
For example, sensors in a cornfield may not have access to power sources or network cables and rely on batteries.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:08.130 
WoT accommodates these constraints by allowing data to be transmitted only when the device is online, helping conserve energy and

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.282 
avoid unnecessary power drain.

00:03:10.713 --> 00:03:18.100 
 Thus WoT's functionality ensures it is both practical and efficient without adding any unnecessary complexity.

00:03:18.561 --> 00:03:25.391 
 Thanks to the interoperability of WoT, cross-domain collaborations are also made possible.

00:03:25.853 --> 00:03:31.719 
In cross-domain collaborations, each system involves other systems in other domains.

00:03:31.719 --> 00:03:37.283 
For example, Smart Factory with Smart City, Smart City with Smart Home.

00:03:37.283 --> 00:03:46.203 
In these models, information can be exchanged directly between systems in a peer-to-peer manner or indirectly via collaboration platforms.

00:03:47.602 --> 00:03:53.340 
 To summarize, WoT provides numerous advantages across its applications:

00:03:53.814 --> 00:03:59.587 
It is domain-agnostic, allowing for seamless integration across various systems.

00:04:00.077 --> 00:04:07.000 
It supports multiple protocols, ensuring interoperability among devices from different manufacturers.

00:04:07.477 --> 00:04:13.506 
WoT is built on open standards, promoting long-term adaptability and innovation.

00:04:13.961 --> 00:04:18.132 
It works with resource-constrained devices, edge or the cloud.

00:04:18.563 --> 00:04:28.168 
 By enabling efficient and secure interactions between devices across different domains, WoT serves as a transformative framework.
