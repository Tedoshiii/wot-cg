00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:13.266 
The Web of Things finds applications in diverse fields beyond smart homes and cities, with industrial and agriculture systems being

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:15.661 
two major and complex examples.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.822 
 Let's first take a look at industrial systems.

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:30.801 
 Industrial applications often resemble smart home scenarios, but come with broader and more demanding requirements. These include advanced monitoring

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:36.621 
of connected manufacturing equipment, tracking products and predicting possible machine failures.

00:00:37.111 --> 00:00:43.720 
 In factories, for example, devices from multiple manufacturers must work together seamlessly.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:54.021 
WoT simplifies this by supporting old and new industrial protocols alike, such as Modbus, Profinet, OPC UA, and MQTT.

00:00:54.021 --> 00:01:01.048 
Each device is described using a Thing Description, which tells other systems exactly how to interact with it.

00:01:01.048 --> 00:01:09.770 
This reduces complexity and engineering effort without introducing overhead or security concerns TDs enhance existing workflows.

00:01:11.538 --> 00:01:19.339 
 TDs also enable a new way to build application logic - whether it's control logic, business logic or mashups

00:01:19.339 --> 00:01:30.090 
- using simple files instead of being locked into proprietary systems. This decouples devices from vendor-specific applications, offering flexibility and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.870 
long-term maintainability.

00:01:32.342 --> 00:01:40.352 
 With TDs, we can add context to the system by including annotations from domain models, providing more meaning to

00:01:40.352 --> 00:01:42.957 
how devices are used within their environment.

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:49.713 
 Moving on to another domain-specific application of WoT â€” agriculture systems.

00:01:50.198 --> 00:02:00.530 
 Agriculture offers a wide range of automation possibilities, from monitoring soil moisture and automating watering, to handling fertilization schedules

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.974 
and machinery operation.

00:02:02.435 --> 00:02:12.222 
However, finding a single solution that fits all needs is challenging, especially for small and medium-sized farms. These farmers often

00:02:12.222 --> 00:02:20.743 
aim to automate just one specific task, like soil monitoring, for example. WoT plays a crucial role as an interoperable

00:02:20.743 --> 00:02:29.647 
interface here, allowing these farmers to integrate only the parts they need without committing to an all-encompassing solution. By enabling

00:02:29.647 --> 00:02:37.995 
flexibility and compatibility across different devices and systems, WoT makes it easier for farms to adopt new solutions at their

00:02:37.995 --> 00:02:39.275 
own pace and budget.

00:02:39.688 --> 00:02:44.091 
 Agriculture systems also come with their own set of constraints.

00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:50.166 
Often, devices in agricultural environments are constrained in terms of power and connectivity.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:57.692 
For example, sensors in a cornfield may not have access to power sources or network cables and rely on batteries.

00:02:59.121 --> 00:03:07.723 
This works well with WoT, as metadata can be stored externally and protocols like MQTT let devices send data only

00:03:07.723 --> 00:03:12.348 
when they're online, conserving energy and avoiding unnecessary power drain.

00:03:12.803 --> 00:03:20.190 
 Thus WoT's functionality ensures it is both practical and efficient without adding any unnecessary complexity.

00:03:20.651 --> 00:03:27.481 
 Thanks to the interoperability of WoT, cross-domain collaborations are also made possible.

00:03:27.943 --> 00:03:33.809 
In cross-domain collaborations, each system involves other systems in other domains.

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:39.373 
For example, Smart Factory with Smart City, Smart City with Smart Home.

00:03:39.373 --> 00:03:48.293 
In these models, information can be exchanged directly between systems in a peer-to-peer manner or indirectly via collaboration platforms.

00:03:49.692 --> 00:03:55.430 
 To summarize, WoT provides numerous advantages across its applications:

00:03:55.903 --> 00:04:01.676 
It is domain-agnostic, allowing for seamless integration across various systems.

00:04:02.166 --> 00:04:09.089 
It supports multiple protocols, ensuring interoperability among devices from different manufacturers.

00:04:09.567 --> 00:04:15.596 
WoT is built on open standards, promoting long-term adaptability and innovation.

00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.221 
It works with resource-constrained devices, edge or the cloud.

00:04:20.653 --> 00:04:30.258 
 By enabling efficient and secure interactions between devices across different domains, WoT serves as a transformative framework.
