Web of Things standards are composed of building blocks centered around the Thing Description. Here, we give a short introduction to each building block of the Web of Things â€” Thing Description, Binding Templates, Discovery, Scripting API and Profiles. In separate later videos, we will explore each individual building block in more detail.
