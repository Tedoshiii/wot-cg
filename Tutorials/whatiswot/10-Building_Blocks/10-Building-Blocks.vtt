00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.926 
In this video, we give a short introduction to each building block of the Web of Things — Thing Description,

00:00:09.926 --> 00:00:19.574 
Binding Templates, Discovery, Scripting API and Profiles. In separate later videos , we will explore each individual building block in

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:21.446 
more detail.

00:00:21.446 --> 00:00:30.036 
Building blocks allow the implementation of systems that conform with the abstract WoT Architecture. Let's take a closer look at

00:00:30.036 --> 00:00:33.522 
the WoT building blocks.

00:00:33.522 --> 00:00:37.741 
A Thing always has a TD, a Thing Description.

00:00:37.741 --> 00:00:44.503 
It is a key building block that provides metadata describing a Thing and its network interface.

00:00:44.503 --> 00:00:50.516 
This TD can be shared directly by the Thing or through the TD Directory — which is what we call

00:00:50.516 --> 00:00:51.752 
Discovery.

00:00:51.752 --> 00:00:56.017 
Things and consumers can be programmed with the Scripting API.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:02.272 
Let’s begin with the Thing Description, or TD — a key component of WoT.

00:01:02.272 --> 00:01:10.979 
All TDs can be processed just like normal JSON documents. Essentially, a TD defines an information model using a semantic

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:21.803 
vocabulary and a serialized JSON representation. It provides both human- and machine-readable metadata describing the capabilities of a Thing.

00:01:21.803 --> 00:01:30.208 
A TD describes a Thing instance with general metadata such as name, ID, and description. It can also contain Interaction

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:39.634 
Affordance metadata and Protocol Bindings (such as Modbus and HTTP), as well as both public and local IP addresses.

00:01:39.635 --> 00:01:44.439 
The second building block is WoT Binding Templates.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:53.198 
The IoT uses a wide variety of protocols to access devices because no single protocol can cover all use cases

00:01:53.198 --> 00:02:01.757 
and requirements. One of the main challenges of the WoT is enabling interactions across this wide variety of platforms.

00:02:01.757 --> 00:02:10.510 
Binding Templates guide application clients on how to use a TD to extract protocol-specific metadata — for example, how to

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:20.053 
communicate using HTTP or Modbus. Essentially, they are blueprints for interacting with Things that use different transport protocols and content

00:02:20.053 --> 00:02:21.585 
types.

00:02:21.585 --> 00:02:30.546 
Here is an example of a TD. This is the JSON serialization of a temperature controller. It tells the consumer

00:02:30.546 --> 00:02:36.711 
to send a Modbus request to read the temperature in the local network. The Thing can also be proxied by

00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:43.307 
a gateway where an HTTP request will be sent instead of a Modbus request.

00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:54.362 
The WoT TD building block enhances interoperability. The goal is to enable communication within the machines or controllers.

00:02:54.363 --> 00:03:05.044 
Typically, a programmer can read the robot's TD and program the controller accordingly.

00:03:05.044 --> 00:03:11.110 
The controller then sends a request to the device from our example to change the temperature.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.493 
The next building block is WoT Discovery.

00:03:14.494 --> 00:03:19.729 
WoT Thing Descriptions must be known or accessible to other systems and devices .

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:27.419 
WoT Discovery accomplishes this by defining mechanisms for distributing and accessing WoT TD over the network.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:35.256 
These mechanisms simplify access to Things and services and support their integration. They are not limited to a local area

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:39.133 
network - they also support remote discovery.

00:03:39.133 --> 00:03:50.058 
The Thing Description Directory service provides mechanisms to register and retrieve WoT metadata and TDs after authentication and authorization.

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:58.761 
The WoT Scripting API is an optional building block that lets developers build applications using reusable scripts.

00:03:58.761 --> 00:04:06.760 
It provides a simple and consistent way to interact with Things described by TDs — such as reading properties, invoking

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.818 
actions, and subscribing to events.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:17.307 
Once you have a TD, you can use the API to build dashboards or automate device logic without worrying about

00:04:17.307 --> 00:04:19.437 
the underlying protocols.

00:04:19.437 --> 00:04:26.746 
By design, TDs are flexible and able to describe anything without any limitations.

00:04:26.746 --> 00:04:33.375 
However, in some cases, depending on the Thing’s purpose, it may be a good idea to limit the TD to

00:04:33.375 --> 00:04:36.398 
prevent unnecessary implementation load.

00:04:36.399 --> 00:04:46.871 
To summarize, WoT enables implementing device logic by reusable scripts executed in a runtime system for IoT applications which aims

00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:50.836 
to improve productivity and reduce integration costs.

00:04:50.836 --> 00:04:56.908
