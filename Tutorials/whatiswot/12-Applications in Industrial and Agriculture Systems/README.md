## Preliminary Script

- The Web of Things finds applications in diverse fields beyond smart homes and cities, with industrial and agriculture systems being two major and complex examples.

- First we'll take a look at industrial systems.

### Industrial systems

- Industrial applications may often resemble smart home applications, but have broader requirements. These include advanced monitoring of connected manufacturing equipment, tracking manufactured products and predicting possible machine failures.

- In factories for example, devices from multiple manufacturers must work together seamlessly. WoT simplifies this by accommodating a variety of industrial protocols, including legacy ones. Each device comes equipped with its own Thing Description, making it clear to other devices and systems how to interact with it, and thus reducing complexity and engineering effort.

### Agriculture systems

- Moving on to another domain-specific application of WoT - agriculture systems. Agriculture offers a wide range of automation possibilities, from monitoring soil moisture and automating watering to fertilization schedules and machinery operation. However, finding a single solution that fits all needs is challenging, especially for small and medium-sized farms. These farmers often aim to automate just one specific task, like soil monitoring, for example.

- WoT plays a crucial role as an interoperable interface here, allowing these farmers to integrate just the parts they need without committing to an all-encompassing solution. By enabling flexibility and compatibility across different devices and systems, WoT makes it easier for farms to adopt new solutions at their own pace and budget.

- Agriculture systems also come with their own set of constraints. Often, devices in agricultural environments are constrained in terms of power and connectivity. For example, sensors in a cornfield may not have access to power sources or network cables and rely on batteries. WoT accommodates these constraints by allowing data to be transmitted only when the device is online, helping conserve energy and avoid unnecessary power drain.

- Thus WoT's functionality ensures it is both practical and efficient without adding any unnecessary complexity.

### Cross-domain Collaboration

- Thanks to the interoperability of WoT, cross-domain collaborations are also made possible. In cross-domain collaborations, each system involves other systems in other domains. For example, Smart Factory with Smart City, Smart City with Smart Home. In these models, information can be exchanged directly between systems in a peer-to-peer manner or indirectly via collaboration platforms.

### Summary

- To summarize, WoT provides numerous advantages across its applications:
    - It is domain-agnostic, allowing for seamless integration across various systems.
    - It supports multiple protocols, ensuring interoperability among devices from different manufacturers.
    - WoT is built on open standards, promoting long-term adaptability and innovation.
    - It works with resource-constrained devices, edge or the cloud.

By enabling efficient and secure interactions between devices across different domains, WoT serves as a transformative framework.
