00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.211 
In the last video, we showed mostly primitive types of JSON. In this video, we will

00:00:06.211 --> 00:00:12.423 
first focus on arrays and objects, and then we will mention common mistakes when writing JSON.

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:18.634 
At the end of the video, we will demonstrate the usage of JSON generation and parsing.

00:00:18.634 --> 00:00:23.522 
In JSON, each value in an array is called an item.

00:00:23.522 --> 00:00:29.184 
Arrays with items of different types are also allowed.

00:00:29.184 --> 00:00:35.624 
Nested objects are allowed in JSON. “measurement” keyword is an example of this.

00:00:35.624 --> 00:00:44.020 
Objects start and end with curly brackets. It is basically defining keywords and mapping these keywords to values.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:51.154 
In this example, we define the name and value pairs to describe the data sent by sensors.

00:00:51.154 --> 00:00:59.366 
There is a JSON array of JSON Objects which means all items are JSON objects in that array.

00:00:59.366 --> 00:01:05.316 
Now we will talk about common mistakes while writing JSON files.

00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:09.429 
Let's start with the space character which is frequently overlooked.

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:11.466 
Space is a character too.

00:01:11.466 --> 00:01:15.304 
So “is Active” is not the same as “is Active blank”

00:01:15.304 --> 00:01:20.017 
Also, JSON is case sensitive. Thus, "is Active" with upper case A

00:01:20.017 --> 00:01:24.731 
is not the same as “is active” with lower case A.

00:01:24.731 --> 00:01:30.372 
Paying attention to this is important to make sure that object assignments and comparisons work.

00:01:30.372 --> 00:01:34.534 
Lets continue with the mistakes about quotation marks.

00:01:34.534 --> 00:01:39.984 
Forgetting quotation marks is wrong, it will show syntax errors everywhere.

00:01:39.984 --> 00:01:44.909 
Also putting them when you should not, causes unwanted results.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.409 
For example → “name”:”true” is not the same as “name”:true without quotation marks.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.622 
The first one is not a boolean but a string so it will be interpreted as a string.

00:01:56.622 --> 00:01:59.497 
The same problem happens with numbers too.

00:01:59.497 --> 00:02:05.997 
This way, the types will be incorrectly interpreted by your programming language.

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:13.372 
Putting comments inside JSON documents is not valid.

00:02:13.372 --> 00:02:17.007 
Commas should not be used at the final name-value pair.

00:02:17.007 --> 00:02:21.288 
That is why the first one is not valid but difficult to see if

00:02:21.288 --> 00:02:25.570 
you are using it inside of a javascript editor rather than a JSON editor.

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:32.248 
Similar to the previous one depending on the programming language that you use, syntax might differ.

00:02:32.248 --> 00:02:38.690 
Since JSON will be the object of that programming language before it is parsed and serialized as JSON.

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.141 
For example, in JSON key-value pairs have to be with quotation marks whereas

00:02:44.141 --> 00:02:49.591 
in JavaScript files it is not necessary to have quotation marks, both work.

00:02:49.591 --> 00:02:52.928 
The syntax of the keywords might differ as well.

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:58.817 
For example, true false keywords in JSON, Rust, JavaScript, and Golang are written lowercase,

00:02:58.817 --> 00:03:04.706 
while in Python the first letter of these keywords needs to be capitalized.

00:03:04.706 --> 00:03:11.043 
Similar to the previous one, the null keyword differs in JSON and Python.

00:03:11.043 --> 00:03:15.271 
In JSON and JavaScript it is null with lowercase while in

00:03:15.271 --> 00:03:19.499 
Python, the same meaning is given with the "None" keyword.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:23.711 
Now let's test JSON out in a real programming environment.

00:03:27.061 --> 00:03:31.958 
Open a code editor. In this example, we used VS Code.

00:03:31.958 --> 00:03:38.509 
Write a JSON file of your choice and save it by giving a file name and adding a .json extension.

00:03:38.509 --> 00:03:42.776 
Then the editor will recognize the file as a JSON document.

00:03:42.776 --> 00:03:49.470 
Now we will read a JSON file from the file system using a JSON library in Python.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:55.938 
We open the JSON file that we have previously saved to the file system with open-as-file key words.

00:03:55.938 --> 00:04:01.205 
Then, we can load that JSON file with the load function into the data object.

00:04:01.205 --> 00:04:04.899 
We can also print it to see what is inside the JSON file.

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:10.237 
Printing the data object in console can look like this.

00:04:10.237 --> 00:04:15.440 
There are many ways to send a JSON file via different protocols, one of

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.643 
them is using Python and its request library for sending an HTTP request.

00:04:20.643 --> 00:04:28.445 
With this library, you can use the post function to send an HTTP POST request with a JSON Payload.

00:04:28.445 --> 00:04:33.830 
As a parameter, it takes the URL to send to and the JSON object.

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.453
